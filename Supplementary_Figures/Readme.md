### Figure S1: Summary of Two-way linear model analysis of wild-type and Zic2 Kumba heterozygous mouse embryos on congenic C3H/HeH and C57BL6/N genetic backgrounds. 
Each page of the pdf represents the labelled organ (heading) segmented within LAMA. A) Schematic summarising statistically main effects (inside curved arrow and red line), interaction effects (red circle) and subsequent Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests. B) A box-plot is shown if either the main or interaction effects from the two-way linear model are statistically significant (p-values round to 5 decimal, so a p-value of 0 is < 5x10^-5). Similarly, line plots C) and D) are displayed if subsequent Tukey's Test are statistically significant. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) plots and Kmeans clusterings are shown if a particular genotype-background combination clusters to multiple groups (at a ratio between 40:60% to 60:40%) and as such may have an incompletely penetrant phenotype.

### Figure S2: Percentage of phenotypic overlap wild-type and Zic2 heterozygous mouse embryos on congenic C3H/HeH and C57BL6/N genetic backgrounds.
Percentage plots showing the percentage of embryos with a particular combination of phenotypes (individual colours) in which phenotypes present in wild-type embryos are A) included or B) omitted.
